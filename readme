## Key Features

- **Multi-Store & Multi-Register:** Manage unlimited stores and registers per tenant. Assign users to stores with granular roles. All sales and inventory operations are tracked by store and register.
- **Robust Offline Mode:** Idempotent offline sales and inventory sync (with `offlineId`, `synced`, `source` fields) for seamless operation when disconnected. Conflict resolution and safe retries.
- **Modular, Production-Ready Backend:** Node.js, Express, ESM modules, scalable architecture.
- **Authentication & RBAC:** JWT, roles, bcrypt, and role-based access control middleware. Per-action and per-resource permissions.
- **Full CRUD:** Products, categories, customers, suppliers, inventory, sales, stores, registers, users.
- **Inventory Management:** Batch updates, adjustment history, low stock/expiring alerts, warehouse and stock movement tracking, batch/serial numbers, multi-warehouse support.
- **Barcode:** Generation & scanning (API endpoints), supports standard barcode formats.
- **Audit Logging:** Winston (file, optional external service), all critical actions logged for compliance and troubleshooting.
- **Validation & Security:** Joi validation, XSS sanitization, CSRF protection, centralized error handling, rate limiting, secure headers.
- **Pagination, Filtering, Search:** On all major endpoints, optimized for large datasets.
- **Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL:** Multi-tenant schema, optimized queries, connection pooling, migrations.
- **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket plugin for inventory/sales events, instant UI updates.
- **Reporting:** Sales and inventory reports, analytics, CSV export.
- **Plugin System:** Drop-in plugins for business logic or integrations. Auto-loaded at startup, clear API for extension.
- **Integrations:** Ready for payment gateways, e-commerce, accounting, ERP (see roadmap).

## Tenant ID Handling & Owner Cheat Code

### Tenant ID Generation

When a new business (tenant) signs up, the system automatically generates a unique tenant ID in the backend. Users should **not** be asked to enter a tenant ID during sign up. The backend creates the tenant, generates the tenant ID, and associates the new owner/admin user and all related data with that tenant. This ensures secure, isolated multi-tenant operation.

For invited users joining an existing business, the invitation flow (e.g., via email invite or token) securely links them to the correct tenant.

### Owner Cheat Code

For development or initial setup, you can use the "owner cheat code" to quickly create an owner/admin user and a new tenant for testing:

- If the system detects no tenants or users in the database, it may allow the first sign up to create both a tenant and an owner/admin user automatically (no tenant ID required).
- Alternatively, you can use a special environment variable or CLI command (see backend documentation or scripts) to bootstrap an owner/admin user and tenant for local development.

> **Note:** Never use the cheat code or initial owner setup in production after onboarding real tenants.

## API Endpoints (Highlights)

- `/api/auth` — Login, register, password reset, profile
- `/api/products`, `/api/categories`, `/api/customers`, `/api/suppliers` — Full CRUD
- `/api/inventory` — CRUD, batch, adjustment history, low stock, expiring, warehouses, stock movement, batch/serial
- `/api/inventory/registers` — List/create registers
- `/api/inventory/sync/sales` — Sync offline sales
- `/api/inventory/sync/inventory` — Sync offline inventory
- `/api/pos` — Process sales
- `/api/sales` — Sales history, details, analytics
- `/api/barcode` — Generate/scan barcodes
- `/api/reports` — Sales/inventory reports, analytics
- `/api/stores` — CRUD, assign/remove users, analytics
- `/api/registers` — List/create registers


## Performance & Scalability

- **Redis Caching:** Hot data (products, inventory) cached in Redis for fast access and reduced DB load.
- **Connection Pooling:** Prisma configured for efficient pooling and optimized queries.
- **Idempotent Sync:** Offline sync endpoints are idempotent and safe for unreliable networks.
- **Horizontal Scalability:** Designed for multi-tenant, multi-store deployments.


## Admin Dashboard

- **Secure Admin Dashboard:** (Planned) Real-time monitoring and management (users, inventory, sales, plugins, logs, etc.).


## Plugin/Extension System

- **Plugins:** Drop-in plugins in `backend/plugins/` to extend business logic or integrate with external services. Plugins are auto-loaded at startup. See `backend/plugins/examplePlugin.js` for a template.


## Security & Best Practices

- JWT authentication, role-based access
- Input validation (Joi), XSS sanitization, CSRF protection
- Centralized error handling
- Audit logging (Winston, file)
- ESM modules throughout
- Rate limiting, secure HTTP headers
